# Overview
Our Realtime Todo App is a modern, responsive task management application built with Next.js, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to create, manage, and track their todos in realtime across multiple devices. The application addresses the common problem of task management with a focus on realtime synchronization, providing users with an always up-to-date view of their tasks regardless of which device they're using.

# Core Features

## User Authentication
- **What it does**: Provides secure login, signup, and account management using Supabase Auth
- **Why it's important**: Secures user data and provides personalized experiences
- **How it works**: Utilizes Supabase Auth with email/password and social login options, implementing protected routes and session management

## Todo Management
- **What it does**: Allows users to create, read, update, and delete todo items
- **Why it's important**: Core functionality of the application
- **How it works**: Uses Supabase database with realtime subscriptions, server actions for mutations, and optimistic UI updates

## Realtime Synchronization
- **What it does**: Updates todos in realtime across all devices/browsers
- **Why it's important**: Provides a seamless experience across multiple devices
- **How it works**: Leverages Supabase realtime subscriptions to push changes to connected clients

## Filtering and Sorting
- **What it does**: Allows users to filter todos by status and sort by various attributes
- **Why it's important**: Improves usability for users with many todos
- **How it works**: Implements client-side filtering/sorting with URL-based state management

## Dark/Light Mode
- **What it does**: Toggles between dark and light visual themes
- **Why it's important**: Accommodates user preferences and reduces eye strain
- **How it works**: Uses Tailwind's dark mode with localStorage persistence

## Data Models

### Users
- Managed by Supabase Auth

### Todos
```sql
create table todos (
  id uuid primary key default uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  title text not null,
  is_complete boolean default false,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);

-- Set up Row Level Security
alter table todos enable row level security;

-- Define access policies
create policy "Users can view their own todos" 
  on todos for select using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Users can insert their own todos" 
  on todos for insert with check (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Users can update their own todos" 
  on todos for update using (auth.uid() = user_id);

create policy "Users can delete their own todos" 
  on todos for delete using (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## APIs and Integrations
1. **Supabase Auth API**: For user authentication
2. **Supabase Database API**: For CRUD operations on todos
3. **Supabase Realtime API**: For realtime updates

## Infrastructure Requirements
- Supabase project (free tier sufficient for MVP)
- Vercel deployment for Next.js frontend
- GitHub repository for version control

# Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: MVP Foundation
1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
   - Set up Supabase project and define database schema
   - Configure testing environment (RTL and Playwright)

2. **Authentication Implementation**
   - Create signup page with form validation
   - Implement login functionality
   - Set up protected routes
   - Add password reset functionality

3. **Basic Todo Management**
   - Create todo CRUD operations
   - Implement basic UI for todo list
   - Add validation for todo inputs

# Logical Dependency Chain

## Foundation First
1. Project setup must be completed before any feature development
2. Authentication system is required before todo functionality (for user-specific data)
3. Basic CRUD operations for todos must exist before implementing filtering or realtime features
4. Core UI components need to be created before adding advanced interactions

## User-Facing Priorities
1. Focus on creating a functioning authentication system first
2. Implement basic todo management to provide immediate value
3. Add realtime synchronization to showcase the app's unique value proposition
4. Enhance UI/UX features incrementally

## Atomic Feature Development
1. Each feature should be developed in small, testable increments
2. Every increment should include:
   - Component implementation
   - Unit tests with RTL
   - E2E tests with Playwright for user flows
   - Documentation updates as needed

3. Example of incremental approach for todo creation:
   - First increment: Basic form component with validation
   - Second increment: Server action for creating todo
   - Third increment: Optimistic UI updates
   - Fourth increment: Realtime reflection of changes

# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Challenges
1. **Realtime Synchronization Complexity**
   - Risk: Managing state between local and server data
   - Mitigation: Start with simple synchronization patterns, thoroughly test edge cases

2. **Authentication Edge Cases**
   - Risk: Security vulnerabilities in authentication flow
   - Mitigation: Use Supabase Auth which handles security best practices, add comprehensive tests

3. **Testing Realtime Features**
   - Risk: Difficulty in testing asynchronous, realtime behaviors
   - Mitigation: Create robust testing utilities, use mocks for deterministic tests

## MVP Scoping
1. **Feature Creep**
   - Risk: Adding too many features to initial release
   - Mitigation: Strictly prioritize features based on user value, maintain focus on core functionality

2. **Overengineering**
   - Risk: Creating overly complex solutions for simple problems
   - Mitigation: Start with simplest implementation that works, refactor as needed

## Resource Constraints
1. **Performance with Large Todo Lists**
   - Risk: UI performance degradation with many todos
   - Mitigation: Implement pagination, virtualization for large lists

2. **Supabase Free Tier Limitations**
   - Risk: Hitting rate limits or storage caps on free tier
   - Mitigation: Implement efficient queries, cache data where appropriate
