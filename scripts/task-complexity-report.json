      "taskTitle": "Authentication System Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Authentication System Implementation into subtasks covering: 1) User signup flow with email verification, 2) Login functionality with session management, 3) Password reset flow, 4) Protected routes implementation with middleware, 5) Authentication UI components, and 6) Error handling and validation. For each subtask, include component requirements, server actions, and testing criteria.",
      "reasoning": "Authentication is inherently complex due to security considerations, multiple user flows (signup, login, password reset), and the need for proper error handling. The implementation uses Next.js server actions and Supabase Auth, which adds complexity through the need to understand both systems. Middleware for protected routes and proper session management further increase complexity."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Todo CRUD Operations",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Todo CRUD Operations task into subtasks covering: 1) Creating new todos with validation, 2) Reading and displaying todos with proper loading states, 3) Updating todo content and completion status, 4) Deleting todos with confirmation, and 5) Error handling and optimistic UI updates. For each subtask, include component requirements, server actions, and state management approaches.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing all CRUD operations with server actions, client components, and proper state management. The complexity comes from handling loading states, error cases, and ensuring a smooth user experience. The code needs to interact with Supabase and manage server/client boundaries in Next.js, which adds complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Realtime Synchronization",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Realtime Synchronization task into subtasks covering: 1) Setting up Supabase realtime subscriptions, 2) Implementing client-side state management for realtime updates, 3) Handling optimistic UI updates with conflict resolution, 4) Managing connection states and reconnection logic, and 5) Testing realtime functionality across multiple clients. For each subtask, include implementation details and edge case handling.",
      "reasoning": "Realtime synchronization is one of the most complex tasks due to its distributed nature. It requires managing subscriptions, handling race conditions, implementing optimistic updates with potential rollbacks, and dealing with network issues. The complexity is high because it involves both client and server state that must stay in sync across multiple potential users."

      "taskTitle": "Filtering and Sorting Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Filtering and Sorting Implementation task into subtasks covering: 1) Creating filter UI components with status options (all/active/completed), 2) Implementing sorting functionality with multiple criteria, 3) Integrating filters with URL parameters for shareable states, and 4) Optimizing performance for filtered and sorted lists. For each subtask, include component requirements and state management approaches.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves moderate complexity with client-side filtering and sorting logic, URL parameter management, and UI components. While not technically difficult, it requires careful state management and consideration of user experience. The integration with URL parameters adds some complexity for maintaining state across page reloads."
